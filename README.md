# netzwerk

A project wrapping modern C++ with Python using CMake, PyBind11, and GoogleTest

## Why PyBind11?

Wrapping modern C++ code in Python provides high-level high-performance code, or (have-your-cake-and-eat-it)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_can%27t_have_your_cake_and_eat_it] for programmers. The cost is the added complexity and code duplication, which PyBind11 minimizes compared to other approaches.
